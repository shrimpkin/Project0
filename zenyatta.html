      <h1> Primary Fire and Health </h1>
       <p> Zenyatta does 48 damage per orb fired. Zenyatta's health pool is composed of 150 shields and 50 health. </p>
      <h1>Abilities</h1>
      <ul>
        <li> Orb of Discord: An orb, which is given to an enemy player, which makes them take 30% extra damage. Is removed upon dying or upon not seeing the target for 3 seconds. Can't be given through enemy shields.</li>
        <li> Orb of Harmony: An orb, which is given to a friendly player, which heals 30hp/sec. Is removed upon dying or upon not seeing the target for 3 seconds. </li>
        <li> Volley: Allows for zenyatta to charge up 5 shots at once by holding right click. Can deal up to 600 damage over a .5 second span. </li>
      </ul>
      <h1> Ultimate </h1>
        <p> Zenyatta's ultimate, transcedance grants him invunerbility as well as a healing aura thats heals 300hp/sec. </p>
      <h1> Positioning </h1>
        <p> General Positioning: Stay near the back of team in a location that is protected from flanks. You will be the primary target for many flankers because of your squishiness. Be prepared to call as soon as you see a flanker for your off tank or second support. </p>
        <p> Flanks: Flanks in which Zenyatta is only revieled for a short period of time can be highly effective. His massive burst potential can allow to one shot all dps and supports in the game. When you start a flank you should discord an enemy and put your orb of harmony on an ally. This will allow you to continue contributing while on your flank. It is probably unwise to flank if the enemy team has snipers that can one shot you. It would also be unwise to flank the same position over and over. </p>
      <h1> Ability usage </h1>
      <ul>
        <li> Orb of Harmony: Should be generally placed on your tank before a fight begins. During a fight move it to people that need healing or flankers on your team that are about to engage</li>
        <li> Orb of Discord: Should be generally placed on enemy tanks before a fight begins. Make sure to call out where the orb is if you move it. Try and place on targets that your flankers are diving. </li>
      </ul>

      <h1> Ultimate Usage </h1>
        <ul>
            <li> Make sure to observe the enemy team composition to see what ults you should attempt to shut down.</li>
            <li> Any ultimate combination involving a dps and Ana or Zarya should be generally ulted to protect your team.</li>
            <li> Always think before you press Q. Make sure the enemy didn't waste their and that your team is actually in danger. </li>
            <li> If you have another support with a protective ult do not ult at the same time. </li>
            <li> Try not to ult to just save yourself but if you dying should swing the fight than ult, if the enemies then have to use their ults that you would have formally prevented it is still better, however, if you are down in a team fight don't ult to save yourself.</li>
        </ul>
